@article{Fawzi2014,
abstract = {The vast majority of today's critical infrastructure is supported by numerous feedback control loops and an attack on these control loops can have disastrous consequences. This is a major concern since modern control systems are becoming large and decentralized and thus more vulnerable to attacks. This paper is concerned with the estimation and control of linear systems when some of the sensors or actuators are corrupted by an attacker. We give a new simple characterization of the maximum number of attacks that can be detected and corrected as a function of the pair {\$}(A,C){\$} of the system and we show in particular that it is impossible to accurately reconstruct the state of a system if more than half the sensors are attacked. In addition, we show how the design of a secure local control loop can improve the resilience of the system. When the number of attacks is smaller than a threshold, we propose an efficient algorithm inspired from techniques in compressed sensing to estimate the state of the plant despite attacks. We give a theoretical characterization of the performance of this algorithm and we show on numerical simulations that the method is promising and allows to reconstruct the state accurately despite attacks. Finally, we consider the problem of designing output-feedback controllers that stabilize the system despite sensor attacks. We show that a principle of separation between estimation and control holds and that the design of resilient output feedback controllers can be reduced to the design of resilient state estimators.},

abstract = {This paper presents a view of cooperative control using the language of learning in games. We review the game theoretic concepts of potential games and weakly acyclic games and demonstrate how the specific cooperative control problem of consensus can be formulated in these settings. Motivated by this connection, we build upon game theoretic concepts to better accommodate a broader class of cooperative control problems. In particular, we introduce sometimes weakly acyclic games for time-varying objective functions and action sets, and provide distributed algorithms for convergence to an equilibrium. Finally, we illustrate how to implement these algorithms for the consensus problem in a variety of settings, most notably, in an environment with non-convex obstructions.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in the application of game theoretic methods to the design and control of multiagent systems. However, the existing game theoretic framework possesses inherent limitations with regards to these new prescriptive challenges. In this paper we propose a new framework, termed state based potential games, which introduces an underlying state space into the framework of potential games. This state space provides a system designer with an additional degree of freedom to help coordinate group behavior and overcome these limitations. Within the context of state based potential games, we characterize the limiting behavior of two learning algorithms termed finite memory better reply processes and log-linear learning. Lastly, we demonstrate the applicability of state based potential games on two cooperative control problems pertaining to distributed resource allocation and the design of local and distributed control laws. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
